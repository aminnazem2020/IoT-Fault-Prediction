### IoT Sensor Fault Prediction Project

This project predicts faults in industrial IoT sensors using machine learning. 

**Project Explanation (generated by LLM):**

IoT sensor fault prediction in industrial networks is about using technology to anticipate when sensors might fail or experience problems. Here’s how it works:

1. **Sensors Collect Data**: Various sensors monitor machines and gather data like temperature, vibration, pressure, humidity, etc.
2. **Data Sending**: Data is sent to a central system for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis**: Machine learning algorithms detect patterns and deviations.
4. **Predicting Failures**: Erratic readings trigger predictions for potential sensor failures.
5. **Alerts and Maintenance**: System alerts maintenance teams to prevent downtime.
6. **Continuous Learning**: The system improves as it gathers more data.

Technologies used: Python, Random Forest, Machine Learning, LLM, IoT.
