# 🏭 Industrial IoT Fault Prediction using Machine Learning

This project simulates IoT sensor data (temperature, vibration, pressure) and trains a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict machine faults.

## 🚀 Features
- Synthetic data generation
- Fault labeling based on threshold logic
- Random Forest fault prediction
- Visualization of anomalies and faults

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 📈 Results
The model predicts machine faults with high accuracy — demonstrating how ML can be used for **predictive maintenance** in industrial IoT systems.
